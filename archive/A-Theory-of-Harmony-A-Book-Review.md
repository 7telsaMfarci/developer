If you are looking for a book that explains the harmonic language of music from a natural-base perspective, you might want to check out *A Theory of Harmony* by Ernst Levy. This book, published by State University of New York Press in 1985, is a highly original and comprehensive theory of harmony developed from tone structure.

Levy was a Swiss-American composer, pianist, and music theorist who had a long and prolific musical career. He taught at various institutions in the United States, including the New England Conservatory, the University of Chicago, Bennington College, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Brooklyn College. He also composed hundreds of works for various genres and instruments, and recorded some of the most challenging piano pieces by Beethoven and Liszt.
 
In *A Theory of Harmony*, Levy presents the essentials of his harmonic theory in a clear and concise way, with abundant musical examples to illustrate his points. He shows how the natural forces in harmony can be derived from the structure of tones and their relations. He also shows how his theory can account for the diverse styles of music from the last few centuries, from Bach to Schoenberg.
 
The book is divided into four parts: Part I introduces the basic concepts of tone structure and natural-base harmony; Part II explores the harmonic implications of tone structure; Part III applies the theory to various musical forms and genres; and Part IV discusses some historical and philosophical aspects of harmony.
 
*A Theory of Harmony* is not a typical textbook on harmony. It does not provide rules or exercises for students to follow. Rather, it is a book that challenges and stimulates the reader to think critically and creatively about harmony. It is a book that reveals the logic and beauty of harmony as a natural phenomenon.

One of the main concepts that Levy introduces in his book is the idea of polarity. Polarity is the relationship between two opposite or complementary elements in music, such as consonance and dissonance, major and minor, or tonic and dominant. Levy argues that polarity is a natural phenomenon that arises from the structure of tones and their intervals. He also shows how polarity can be used to analyze and understand the harmonic progressions and modulations of various composers.
 
Another concept that Levy explores is the natural seventh. The natural seventh is a type of seventh chord that is built on the natural overtone series, rather than the tempered scale. The natural seventh has a ratio of 4:5:6:7, which means that it is slightly different from the major or minor seventh chords that we are used to. Levy claims that the natural seventh is a more consonant and stable chord than the tempered seventh chords, and that it can be used as a substitute for the tonic or dominant chords in some cases.
 
Levy's theory of harmony has influenced many musicians and theorists, especially those who are interested in exploring alternative harmonic systems and possibilities. Some examples of musicians who have used or experimented with Levy's ideas are Jacob Collier, Steve Coleman, John Coltrane, and Ernst Krenek. Levy's theory of harmony can also be related to other concepts such as negative harmony, spectralism, microtonality, and just intonation.
