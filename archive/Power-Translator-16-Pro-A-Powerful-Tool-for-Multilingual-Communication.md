Power Translator 16 Pro is not only a translation software, but also a powerful tool for designing and rendering 3D models and scenes. It can import large and complex CAD files from various formats, such as SolidWorks, Parasolid, IGES, STEP, SAT, and Rhino, and convert them into high-quality meshes that are compatible with 3ds Max. You can also edit and repair the imported surfaces using the Power NURBS toolset, which provides advanced features such as trimming, blending, filleting, offsetting, and more.
 
Power Translator 16 Pro also offers a resolution-independent mesh feature that allows you to adjust the polygon count of the imported objects according to your needs. You can increase the resolution for high-quality rendering, or decrease it for faster performance and interactivity. You can also use the Power Edge Mesh feature to create a clean and smooth mesh that resembles a NURBS surface. This improves the wireframe visibility and eliminates the problems of mesh smoothing and reversed faces.
 
Power Translator 16 Pro is a must-have software for design visualization professionals who work with CAD data in 3ds Max. It can save you time and effort by importing your models and assemblies quickly and accurately, without losing any details or quality. It can also help you enhance your creativity and productivity by giving you more control and flexibility over your imported geometry. With Power Translator 16 Pro, you can communicate your ideas and designs in any language and any format.
